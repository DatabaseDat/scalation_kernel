# Contribution Guidelines

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to
help this project come to fruition.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to `scalation_kernel`](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_kernel/pull/new/master)
with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits.
One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look
like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it.
We optimize for readability.
More information and examples will be added here soon.
